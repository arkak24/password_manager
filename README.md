# 🔐 Encrypted Password Manager (Python)

A simple and secure command-line password manager built with Python that stores passwords in encrypted form using `bcrypt` and `cryptography`.

---

## 📦 Features

- Store, retrieve, and manage passwords securely.
- Uses **bcrypt** for password hashing and **cryptography** for symmetric encryption.
- Data is encrypted before being stored.
- Designed to run in a **Python virtual environment** for isolation and safety.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `bcrypt` library
- `cryptography` library

---

## 🧪 Setting Up the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project in a virtual environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install bcrypt cryptography
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure the virtual environment is activated, then:

```bash
python main.py
```

*(Replace `main.py` with your actual script name if it's different.)*
